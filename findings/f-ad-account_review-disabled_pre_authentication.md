# Kerberos Pre Authentication Not Enabled

## Kerberos Pre Authentication Not Enabled [f-ad-account_review-disabled_pre_authentication]

**Description:**

During the Active Directory review, {number of accounts} user accounts were identified with disabled pre-authentication.

**Risk:**

When Kerberos pre-authentication is not enforced, an unauthenticated attacker can send requests for authentication (AS-REQ) to the Key Distribution Center (KDC). The KDC then replies to the request and the reply contains an encrypted TGT (AS-REP). The attacker can extract the encrypted part of the reply and brute force the account password offline. This attack is known as AS-REP roasting.

**Mitigations:**

Enforce Kerberos Pre Authentication for all user accounts in the domain and ensure the accounts are configured with strong passwords.
