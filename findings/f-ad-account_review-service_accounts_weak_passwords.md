# Service Accounts with Weak Passwords

## Service Accounts with Weak Passwords [f-ad-account_review-service_accounts_weak_passwords]

**Description:**

A service account is a user account that is created explicitly to provide a security context for 
services running on Windows Server operating systems. The security context determines the service's 
ability to access local and network resources. 

If such an account has a configured Service Principal Names (SPN) it makes it vulnerable to Kerberoasting
attack which can be used for offline password cracking.

The following accounts with Service Principal Names (SPN) configured were identified with weak passwords:

**Risk:**

An attacker can exploit a vulnerability of the service or try to attack the server where  the service is running.  <If successful he will obtain full control of the Active Directory,  including all users, computers and confidential data.>


**Mitigations:**

Remove or disable all unnecessary service accounts in the domain.

Where appropriate, consider using Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) instead of user accounts with the "Password Never Expires" flag enabled. gMSAs provide automatic password management and rotation for service accounts, reducing the risk of compromised passwords. MSAs cannot be locked out, and cannot perform interactive logons.

Set the minimum length of the passwords for such accounts greater than 26 characters and updated at least every 1 to 2 years.
