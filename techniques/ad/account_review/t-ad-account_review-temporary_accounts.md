# Temporary Accounts

## Temporary Accounts [t-ad-account_review-temporary_accounts]

Identify any currently enabled accounts with "test", "temp" or "tmp" in the name. If there are excessive numbers of these, and/or some of these have been active for more than 30 days, it's likely that these testing accounts have been forgotten and remain active.

###  Enumerate user accounts that have temp/tmp/test in their usernames.

```bash
Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $TRUE -and sAMAccountName -like "*tmp*"} | select sAMAccountName
Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $TRUE -and sAMAccountName -like "*temp*"} | select sAMAccountName
Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $TRUE -and sAMAccountName -like "*test*"} | select sAMAccountName

```
