## AV bypass with codecepticon [t-ad-defense_evasion-av-donet_codecepticon]

Codecepticon is a .NET application that allows you to obfuscate C#, VBA/VB6 (macros), and PowerShell source code, and is developed for offensive security engagements such as Red/Purple Teams. What separates Codecepticon from other obfuscators is that it targets the source code rather than the compiled executables, and was developed specifically for AV/EDR evasion.
Codecepticon allows you to obfuscate and rewrite code, but also provides features such as rewriting the command line as well.
