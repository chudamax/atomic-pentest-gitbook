# MSRPC Enumeration

## MSRPC Enumeration [t-ad-rpc-rpc_enumeration]

MSRPC, or Microsoft Remote Procedure Call, is a modified version of the standard DCE-RPC (Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls) protocol. DCE-RPC is a protocol that allows for remote execution of procedures or methods across a network, essentially letting different software components communicate in a distributed computing environment.
MSRPC can use multiple transport protocols including TCP/IP, SMB to establish communications between the client and the server. Along with IPC$ transport, TCP, UDP, and HTTP are used to provide access to services.
In MSRPC, the specific services available for remote procedure calls are referred to as "endpoints." These can be dynamically or statically allocated.
